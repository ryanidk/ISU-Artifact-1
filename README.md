# ISU Artifact 1 - Shape Calculator

### [Access the website here](https://isu-artifact-1.ryanidk.com/)

This is the code I wrote for the 1st ISU, on the topics of volume relationships, measurement calculations in three dimensions, and effects of changing dimensions. 
This website is a simple calculator for shapes, featuring many 2D and 3D shapes, as well as a pythagorean theorem calculator for right triangles. The 2D shape calculators calculate both area and perimeter (circumference for circles), the 3D shape calculators calculate both surface area and volume, and the pythagorean theorem calculator calculates both the hypotenuse and unknown side (with hypotenuse and other side).

Written in Python + Flask, and frontend UI is simple HTML/CSS/JS. Run using Gunicorn on a free Oracle Cloud infrastructure instance with 2 Ampere A1 ARM vCPUs and 12GB of RAM.

## TODO
- [ ] Add surface area and perimeter to the quiz???
